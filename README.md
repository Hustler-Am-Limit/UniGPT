## FAQ
### How does UniGPT work?
In a nutshell, UniGPT was fed with scraped websites of the University of Vienna (e.g. univie.ac.at/en, studieren.univie.ac.at/en) and its contents were stored in a vector database that allows for semantic search and retrieval.

When you ask a question, UniGPT will search through the pre-scraped website contents and find the most relevant ones using the vector index. Then, it will use GPT-3.5 to generate a final answer.

### Is my data safe?
